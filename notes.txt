solved the issue of overwriting/updating the user input as the timestamp gets updated by separating and replacing the function
that updates the timeline where the chat gets updated and before scanning for user input

fixed the username issue
works on localhost
fixed files structure

issues:
- fix/update sender time (optional ig)
-when a user change their name and then someone else joins, the previous messages shows their messgaes as two different ppl
-if chat is updated as the user writes, his unsent message is removed
- if the chat is updated as the user writes, his previous unsent message will be saved and will be concatenated with his new message (to others)
-empty messages


// all the issue are solved
